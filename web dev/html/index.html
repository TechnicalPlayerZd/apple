    <h3>Basic Styling</h3>
    <br>
    <p>As you can see, marked text seems to be a bit unique with its additional styling component</p>
    <p>How do we apply this to other examples?</p>
    <p style="color: red;">
        This paragraph is styled with red text color.
    </p>
    <p style="color: green;">
        This paragraph is styled with green text color.
    </p>
    <p style="color: blue;">
        This paragraph is styled with blue text color.
    </p>
    <p style="color: blue; font-size: 20px; background-color: lightyellow; border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px;">
        This paragraph has multiple styles applied to it, including text color, font size, background color, border, and padding.
    </p>
    cool, how did we get here?
    <p>
        Html stylizing by using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a powerful way to enhance the appearance of web pages. <br>
        CSS allows you to apply styles to HTML elements, controlling aspects such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.
    </p>
    <p>
        How we use CSS is by using the box method provided that allows for more advanced forms of stylization:
        <ol>
            <li>Content: The actual content of the element, such as text or images.</li>
            <li>Padding: The space between the content and the border. It creates space inside the element.</li>
            <li>Border: The line that surrounds the padding (if any) and content. You can style the border with different colors, widths, and styles.</li>
            <li>Margin: The space outside the border that separates the element from other elements on the page.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <tt>**We are going into a slightly more advanced topic using CSS, which we will the focus of the next class</tt>
    <p>Here is an example image demonstrating CSS box model:</p>
    <img src="images/css_demo.png"
    height="200"
    alt="This is a demo of the css box method">
    <br>
    <p>Lets work from inside to outside</p>
    <br>
    <p>1. Add padding</p>
    <p style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 20px;">
        This paragraph has padding inside the box.
    </p>
    <p>2. Add border</p>
    <p style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 20px; border: 3px solid blue;">
        This one now has a border!
    </p>
    <p>3. Add margin</p>
    <p style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 20px; border: 3px solid blue; margin: 30px;">
        This paragraph has margin separating it from others.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Lets compare visually</p>
    <p style="background-color: lightcoral; padding: 10px; border: 2px dashed red; margin: 10px;">
        Box 1
    </p>
      
    <p style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 30px; border: 5px solid green; margin: 50px;">
        Box 2
    </p>
    <p>So as you can see</p>
    <p>Usually the margin is just the empty space around the element</p>
    <p>The border is the line surrounding the element</p>
    <p>The padding is the space between the content and the border, it looks like filler</p>
